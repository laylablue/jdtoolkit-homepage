      <p>
     This is the same picture of my friends but edited differently. I over-laid a picture of an anime death god, from the show Deathnote. I also turned everything red except the death god and also layed text over the picture.

     This is the original creative picture, but I used pictures I hadn't previously used, but I decided to keep it on the website.
