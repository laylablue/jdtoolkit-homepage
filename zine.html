  	This is a Zine made by Layla Rudolph. 
  	I made this Zine in Adobe In Design. I designed the whole thing myself from how the words would look to where the pictures would go. I decided to do it on sex work and ethical porn because I think there is a lack of knowledge about these things due to older generations deeming them taboo. When in the culture and age group I surround myself with celebrates sex work and sex positivity.
